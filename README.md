# Dijstra-s-Algorithm

Main: Dijstra.java

Usage: javac Dijstra <input file name/path>


This project builds an adjacency list of edges storing distances between cities from an input file of specific format and runs Dijstra's Algorithm to find the cheapest path to every destination from an initial city.

TODO
- [x] Finish testing supportive data structures
- [x] Finish writing Binomial Queue insert method
- [x] Finish writing Binomial Queue removeMin method
- [x] Finish writing Binomial Queue updateCost method
- [x] Write actual Djstra's algorithm code portion in main
- [] ???Profit



Data structures used:

 - HashTable
 - Adjacency List
 - Binomial Queue


Completed as of 5/11/2016
